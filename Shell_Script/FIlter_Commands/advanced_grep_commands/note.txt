Advanced GRep : -f, -e, -E
================================

NOte: Pattern is a string and it represents more than one string


- "-f" : Takes search string/pattern from a file, one per line
ex: grep -f "filename_which_contains_lines_word" "filename_which_contains_lines_word



- "-e" :
ex: grep -e "text" -e "text1" -e "text2" text.txt OR
grep -E "line|above|python|bash|shell" text.txt


- "-E" : grep -E "line|above|python|bash|shell" text.txt


========================================================
RULES TO CREATE PATTERNS
========================================================

1- XY|PQ Matches for xy or PQ
2- ^xyz matches for the lines which are starting with "xyz"
    ex: grep -E "^this" test.txt    "This command will find the lines which starts from *this

3- xyz$ matches for the lines which are ending with xyz
    ex: rep -E "this$" test.txt

4- ^$ Matches for the lines which are empty

5- \ TO remove the special purpose of any symbol. Ex: \^\$
    ex: grep -E "\^" text.txt

6- . Matches any one character
    ex: grep -E "t..s" text.txt

7- \. matches exactly wth .
    ex: grep -E "\." text.txt

8- \b match the empty string at the edge of word.
    ex: grep -E "\bline" test.txt #This will print the lines before the space
        grep -E "line/b" test.txt #This will print the lines after the space

9- ? The preceding character is optional and will be matched, at most, once
    ex: grep -E "yf?" text.txt


10- * The preceding character will be matched zero or more times.
    ex: grep -E "yf*" text.txt

11- + THe preceding character will be matched one or more times.
    ex: rep -E "yf+" text.txt

12- [xyz] : Matches for the lines which are having x or y or zero
    ex: grep -E "[XYZ]" test.txt
    
13- [a-d] : is equal to [abcd] matched for the lines which are having a/b/b/d
    ex: grep -E "a|b|c|d" test.txt
    ex: grep -E "[a-f]" test.txt

14- [a-ds-z]is equal to [abcdstuvwxzyz]
    ex: grep -E "[a-ds-z]" test.txt

15- ^[abc] matches for the lines which are starting with a/b/character
    ex: grep -E "^[XY"] test.txt
    ex: grep -E "[^xy] test.txt #This command will search the words other than x or y.

16- {N} : The preceding string matched exactly N Time.
    ex: grep -E "xf{4}" test.txt    #This command will try to find f four times.
    ex: grep -E "xf{4,5,6,}"\b test.txt #This command will try to find f 4/5/6 times.
    ex: grep -E "xf{2,}" test.txt       #This command will try to find more than 2 times.
