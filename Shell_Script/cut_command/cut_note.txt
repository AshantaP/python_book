The "cut" command is a powerful tool to extract parts of the each line from a file.
It's based on 
    - BYte position
    - Character position
    - Fields based on delimeter (By default delimeter is the tab)

Note: If characters are separated by "tab" then automatically cut command will filter the Fields
BUt if the characters are separted by filed separator":" then you will have to use delimeter.


CUt command syntax:

cut [options] <position(fields)> /range of position('field)> <input_file>

cat file | cut [options] <position(fields) /range of position(fields)>

options: -b -c and -f

rages:
    2 : only second byte/characters/field
    -2: first to two
    3,6 : Third to six

1- tO CUT OUT a section of a line by specifying a byte/characters position use the -b.-c options

SYntax:
    - cut -b <position>/range of position> file
    - cut -c <position's/range of position> file
    - position: 3,5,10
    - Range of position: 3-7, 6-10

use --complement to complement the output


2- TO cut out a section of a line by specifying a field position use the -f position

Assume fields are like columns, by default cut command will separates columns based on tab(delimeter)

if we want to use different field separator use -d (delimeter)

synatx:
    - cut -f <position's/range of position> file
    - cut -f <position's/range of position> [-d] [--output-delimeter="**] filename
    -d is a deli like @, :/etc ....
    - position's : 3,5,2
    - Range of position's: 3-7,6-10

Use -s option with -f to ignore the line do not contain a delimeter

cut -f -7,9 --output-delimeter="" mytext.txt
